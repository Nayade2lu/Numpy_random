This repository will contain a Jupyter notebook with the following contents:

- Purpose of the numpy.random package
- Use of “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions
- Analysis of five of the distributions provided for in the package. 
- Analysis of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers


Plan to develop the task:
1. Create a local repository
2. Create the Jupyter Notebook for the task
3. Syncronize the repository with gitHub
4. Initial run of numpy.random in Jupyter Notebook using rand function
5. Documentation and explanation of the numpy.random package
6. Investigate and describe the distributions and select the 5 to work with in this task
7. Run the 5 distributions 
8. Show results of the distributions in histograms or plots
9. Investigate "Simple Random data" and "permutations"
10. Analysis of seeds
11. Conclusion
